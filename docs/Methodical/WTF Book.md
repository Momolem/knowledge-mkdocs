In the mentioned article a nice practice for handling issues in new projects is explained. 

## What is a WTF Book
A WTF Book can be a new page in a bullet journal, in which you write down all the annoying things where you think "WTF is this. Why is it done like this?". You do not communicate the issues with the team you are new in. 

## Whats the use of a WTF Book
Over the timespan of a month you might figure out that some of these issues have actually valid reasons why they are like they are, or they might already be known and being addressed somehow. If you would have mentioned all of the issues up front, you might establish an image of "thats the person who always complains". If you wait what the real unknown issues are you can use this as an advantage and establish an image that you are a person who can help if problems arise.
